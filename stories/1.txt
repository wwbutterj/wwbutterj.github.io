Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 1

Once upon a time, in a cool world, there were 3 friends. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny. Johnny was a cricket, Butter was a caterpillar, and Watu Watu was a shark. Once upon a time, they got into their Dodge CarBoat (a boat that can turn into a car) and headed over to the Xfinity store to get some more coach prime videos. They said it would cost $100, so they stopped using Xfinity and switched to YouTube to get the videos for free. They all lived happily ever after.
