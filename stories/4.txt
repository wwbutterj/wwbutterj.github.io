Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 4!!
Watu Watu, Johnny, and Butter were flying in their red helicopter when they saw a group of animals in trouble. A baby elephant had fallen into a deep hole and couldn’t get out. The other animals were trying to help, but they couldn’t do it alone. Watu Watu, Johnny, and Butter knew that they had to help the baby elephant. So, they landed the helicopter and used their teamwork to rescue the baby elephant. Butter used his super strength to lift the elephant out of the hole, while Johnny and Watu Watu helped to guide it to safety. The other animals were so grateful that they threw a big party for Watu Watu, Johnny, and Butter.
