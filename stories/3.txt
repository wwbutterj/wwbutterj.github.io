Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 3!

Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny were very happy with their new job. They loved flying in their red helicopter and recording the news. One day, while they were flying over the city, they saw a big fire in a building. They quickly flew to the building and saw that there were people trapped inside. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny knew that they had to help the people. So, they landed the helicopter on the roof of the building and used the ladder to climb down to the window where the people were trapped. Butter used his super speed to break open the window and Watu Watu helped the people climb up the ladder to safety. Johnny was keeping an eye on everything from above. After everyone was safe, they flew back to CNN and told them about what happened. CNN was very happy with them and gave them a big bonus for being heroes. They all lived happily ever after.
