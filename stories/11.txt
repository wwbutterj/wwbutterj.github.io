Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 11!
One sunny day, Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny were on a walk in the neighborhood. They heard a loud noise coming from a parked car. When they went closer, they saw a dog inside the car. The poor dog looked very hot and scared. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny knew they had to help. They looked around for the dog's owner, but nobody was there. The car windows were closed, and the sun was shining brightly. The dog needed help fast! Butter used his sticky silk to make a long thread, and Johnny chirped to get the dog's attention. They worked together to carefully open the car door. As soon as the door was open, the dog jumped out, panting and wagging its tail. It was so relieved to be out of the hot car. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny gave the dog some water and comforted it. They waited for a while, hoping the owner would come back, but nobody showed up. They decided to take the dog to the nearest animal shelter, where it would be safe and cool. The people at the shelter were very thankful and promised to find the dog a loving home. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny felt happy that they had saved the dog from the hot car. They learned that it's important to look out for others and help when someone is in trouble. They walked away, knowing they had done a good deed, and they all lived happily ever after.
