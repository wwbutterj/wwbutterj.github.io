Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 5!
Watu Watu, Johnny, and Butter were on a mission to find the lost city of gold. They had heard that it was hidden deep in the jungle, but they didn’t know where to start looking. So, they decided to ask the animals for help. They flew their helicopter over the jungle and asked every animal they saw if they knew where the lost city of gold was. Finally, they met a wise old owl who told them that the city was hidden behind a waterfall. They followed the owl’s directions and found the city of gold! They were amazed by all the treasure they found there.
