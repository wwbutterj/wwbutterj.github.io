Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 2
Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny wanted a helicopter. So, Watu Watu and Johnny drove Butter to the caterpillar bank where they had 3 million dollars. Butter started to walk into the bank, until the security guard almost stepped on him! He used his super speed to scurry out of the way, wrote a sticky note, and the security guard said sorry. So, Butter took 1 million dollars out of the bank to buy the helicopter. The security guard lifted Butter back into the car, and they drove to the Dodge dealership and bought a helicopter. They flew to the CNN office while their cool valet drove their car boat back to their underwater home, and then CNN gave them a newscopter job. They painted the helicopter red, and put a CNN sticker on it, and they started recording with the 8 cameras on the copter. In 2 weeks, they all loved the job. The best part? It was paying them $10,000 per day, EACH! That was 3.6 million dollars a year, each! Thatâ€™s 10.8 million dollars a year in total! So, they all lived a happy life together recording in the newscopter.
