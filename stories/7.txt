Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 7!!!!
Watu Watu, Johnny, and Butter were on a camping trip when they heard about a mysterious creature that lived in the forest. They decided to investigate and see if they could find it. They searched high and low but couldnâ€™t find anything until one night when they heard strange noises coming from deep in the forest. They followed the noises until they came across a friendly Sasquatch! The Sasquatch was happy to see them and showed them around his home in the forest.
