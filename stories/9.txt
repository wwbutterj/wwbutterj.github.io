Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket !!!!!9!!!!
Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny found a magic time machine one sunny day. It was a big shiny box with lots of buttons. They decided to press some buttons and see where it would take them. The time machine started to shake and spin around. Then, whoosh! They traveled back in time to a place called Mount Vernon. It was a very long time ago. They saw a man in a fancy hat and old clothes. His name was George Washington, and he was the leader of a big group of people fighting in a war called the Revolutionary War. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny wanted to help George Washington and his friends. They asked George if they could join the fight. George Washington said, "Sure, you can help us!" He gave them tiny muskets and showed them how to march and be brave. They all went to a big field where there was a big fight happening. Boom! There were loud noises from the cannons and lots of people in red coats on one side and people in blue coats on the other side. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny did their best to help. Watu Watu jumped out of the water and scared the redcoats away. Butter used his super sticky silk to make traps for the redcoats, and Johnny chirped loudly to give courage to their friends. With Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny's help, George Washington's side won the battle! They were all very happy and cheered together. George Washington thanked Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny for their help. He said, "You are true heroes!" Then, they all went back to the magic time machine. They pressed some buttons again, and whoosh! They were back in their own time. They said goodbye to George Washington and his friends and went back to their adventures. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny had lots of exciting stories to tell about their time-travel adventure, and they all lived happily ever after.
