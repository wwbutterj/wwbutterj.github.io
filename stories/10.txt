Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket X
One night, Butter and Johnny decided to go on an adventure. They quietly sneaked downstairs in their cozy house and tiptoed outside. They remembered the muskets that George Washington had given them. They had heard about a big fight happening up in a place called Mount Vernon. George had told them that England had new fighters called Germans, and they were helping England in the war. George said it was important for America to win. So, Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny took their muskets and headed to Mount Vernon. They knew they needed to stop the Germans and help America. When they got to the battlefield, there were loud noises from cannons and lots of people in red coats and funny hats. But this time, there were also Germans with their special uniforms. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny did their best to help. Watu Watu swam fast and scared the redcoats and Germans with his big shark fins. Butter used his sticky silk to make traps, and Johnny chirped loudly to give courage to their friends. With their help, America won the war! Everybody was happy, and they celebrated together. When the war was over, Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny decided to go back to their magic time machine. They pressed the buttons, and whoosh! They were back in their own time. But something amazing happened. They became friends with England and Germany. They all talked and played together, and there was no more fighting. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny learned that being friends was better than fighting, and they all lived happily ever after.
