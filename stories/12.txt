Watu Watu the Shark, Butter the Caterpillar, and Johnny the Cricket 12
One bright morning, Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny woke up with big smiles on their faces. They decided it was a perfect day for a picnic in the park. So, they packed their favorite snacksâ€”seaweed sandwiches for Watu Watu, leaf salads for Butter, and crunchy cricket chips for Johnny. They hopped into their magical car boat and zoomed to the park. As they spread their picnic blanket, they noticed some sad faces nearby. A group of little ducklings had lost their way and couldn't find their mama. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny knew they had to help. Butter quickly crafted a trail of sticky silk to guide the ducklings back to their mama. Johnny chirped cheerfully, trying to lift the spirits of the little ducklings. The plan worked like magic! The ducklings followed the shiny silk path, and soon enough, they were happily reunited with their mama duck. Quacks of joy filled the air. The mama duck waddled over to Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny, flapping her wings in gratitude. She gave them each a little peck on the cheek, thanking them for helping her precious ducklings. Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny were overjoyed to see the happy duck family. They shared their picnic goodies with the ducks, and everyone enjoyed a delightful day in the park. As the sun set, the duck family quacked a melody of thanks, and Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny felt warm and fuzzy inside. With hearts full of happiness, they packed up their picnic and headed home, knowing they had made new feathered friends. And so, Watu Watu, Butter, and Johnny lived happily ever after, cherishing the memory of their duckling adventure.
